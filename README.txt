#Handwriting Machine Learning

Uses data from MNIST database in /resources to teach a network to recognise the digits 0-9
network.h is the network namespace, that manages and trains the network
data.h is the data namespace, that imports and holds the training data
UI.h is the user interface namespace
character_display.py produces an image of the character in /output
/notused contains files that aren't currently used in the main program: an OpenGL module to view the characters and a python script to import data from a different file format
